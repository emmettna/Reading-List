  <h1>Refactoring by Martin Fowler</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Chapter 1</li>
        <p>1. Ugly and too long codes(unnecessarilly) prone to cause mistakes and bugs
          impossible to reuse. Which means, it will be difficult to change the code when
          your client askes some changes.</p>
        <p>2. Make a solid test unit in advance of refactoring.</p>
        <p>3. First target is overly long statement method. Extract methods
          then don't forget to run the test after changes.</p>
        <p>4. After split massive methods into chunks change the variables</p>
        <p>5. a method should be on the object whoses data it uses</p>
        <p>6. get rid of temp variables and locally scoped variables as much as you canvas</p>
        <p>7. replacing temp variables with queries is another great option.</p>
        <p>8. Switch statement better stay with the origin of values (migrate the method to
          the class holds the data.)</p>
        <p>9. Replace type code with State/strategy</p>
        <p>10. Extract Method, Move Method and Replace conditions with Polymorphism</p>
      <li>Chapter 2</li>
        <p>1. When you refactor there are to steps. Change the codes and add functions
          Don't try to add function and change the code at the same time. It will end up
          impossible code to look up</p>
        <p>2. without refctoring, even good codes can lose it's design. Programming is saying
          what your device to respond. if you want it to answer correctly. Better say it clearly</p>
        <p>3. So when to refactor? When you add new function, reported bugs and when you review the codes</p>
        <p>4. Many cases your project is coupled with Database, put a middle layer so when you change code,
          you don't need to change codes in database.</p>
        <p>5. Interface is treakier to deal with. let the old codes connect to new code. so peope using the interface
          won't have to change.</p>
        <p>6. when it comes to performance, small tiny code is not the solution. try the overall codes.</p>
